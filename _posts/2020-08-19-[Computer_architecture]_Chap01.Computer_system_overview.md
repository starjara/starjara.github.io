1.1 Basic architecture of computer

    1. CPU - CPU is short hand of Central Processing Unit and it's important part of computer, because it's decide computer's performance
             CPU can handle 1 word at 1 time
             Generaly 1 word is started from 8bits and increase by a factor of 2
             ex) 8 - 16 - 32 - 64
    
    2. Memory - Memory is divided into main memory and auxiliary storage device
                2.1 Main memory
                    All tasks are loaded on main memory and excuteted
                    it can be accessed fast but expensive and have small space and loaded data can volatilize
                    ex) RAM
                2.2 Auxiliary stroage device
                    Auxiliary stroage device is slower than CPU and mainmemory but it have large space and cheap
                    and it can store data to permanently
                    ex) HDD (Hard disk drive)

    3. I.O device - I/O device is for interaction with user
                    CPU can't be exchanging data with I/O device directly
                    ex) Keyboard, mouse

1.2 Presentation and storage of information

1.3 System configuration

1.4 History of computer architecture
